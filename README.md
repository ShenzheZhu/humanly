**Write with AI. Prove your process.**

Humanly is a writing provenance platform for human-AI work. It gives writers a
controlled workspace for drafting with configurable AI support, and it gives
reviewers a certificate that shows how the writing process unfolded.

## Product

Humanly has two first-party web apps:

- **User portal:** [app.writehumanly.net](https://app.writehumanly.net/) for
  personal writing, assigned tasks, PDF-backed writing, AI-assisted drafting,
  submissions, and certificates.
- **Admin dashboard:** [admin.writehumanly.net](https://admin.writehumanly.net/)
  for creating tasks, configuring writing environments, distributing share
  links, reviewing submissions, and inspecting certificates.

## Features

- **Configurable writing environments** for personal writing and assigned
  tasks, including AI access, copy-paste rules, time limits, instructions, PDF
  access, and task attempts.
- **AI policy controls** that can disable AI, allow only selected-text polish,
  allow only chat, or allow full in-platform assistance.
- **Process tracing** for typing, editing, copy/paste, focus, navigation,
  workspace activity, and in-platform AI interactions.
- **PDF context** so writers can draft beside source material and use approved
  AI support over uploaded PDFs.
- **Task distribution** through invite codes and public share links, including
  account or guest participation depending on the task setting.
- **Shareable certificates** with authorship statistics, replay, environment
  settings, abnormal-behavior review signals, and integrity details.

## Self-Host Quick Start (TL;DR)

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=20.19.0 <21`
- pnpm `>=9.0.0 <10`
- Docker and Docker Compose

Start the full local stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

Then open:

- Admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
- User portal: `http://localhost:3002`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3001`

Default local admin account:

```text
Email:    admin@mail.com
Password: admin123456
```

Stop the quickstart stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml down
```

Reset local quickstart data:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml down -v
```

For manual setup, environment variables, and persistent self-deployment notes,
see [docs/SELF_DEPLOY.md](https://github.com/ShenzheZhu/humanly/blob/main/docs/SELF_DEPLOY.md).

## Certificates

A Humanly certificate can show:

- the submitted document and final text statistics;
- the writing environment and task rules active during writing;
- authorship statistics for typed, pasted, and AI-assisted text;
- event logs for writing, navigation, copy/paste, and AI activity;
- replay and abnormal-behavior review signals where available;
- certificate integrity details.

Certificates are evidence for review. They describe what happened inside the
Humanly workspace and do not make claims about off-platform behavior.

## Architecture

Humanly is a pnpm workspace with one backend service, two Next.js apps, and
shared packages for the writing editor, tracking, and cross-app types.

```text
packages/backend        Express API, storage, events, certificates, AI
packages/frontend       Admin dashboard
packages/frontend-user  User portal and writing workspace
packages/editor         Writing editor
packages/tracker        External-form tracking library
packages/shared         Shared types and utilities
```

Local and production deployments use PostgreSQL for durable data, Redis for
cache and realtime support, and file/object storage for uploaded PDFs and
attachments.
